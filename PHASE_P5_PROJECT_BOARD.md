- **Dependency Delays** - Identify alternatives early
- **Integration Complexity** - Plan buffer time for testing

## Notes

This project board structure follows the detailed 4-week Phase P5 plan provided by the user. Week 1 has been successfully completed with all deliverables achieved:

1. âœ… **DailySnapshot HTML Renderer** - Professional Bootstrap-styled reports with responsive design
2. âœ… **Slack Integration** - Full-featured alerter with digest formatting and error handling  
3. âœ… **CLI Integration** - Multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, email) with flexible options
4. âœ… **Prefect Flow Integration** - Automated report generation as Phase 8 of daily trading flow

The infrastructure is now ready for Week 2 dashboard development, with solid foundations for data access, reporting, and alerting in place.
