## üö® Risk Assessment

### High Risks (Impact: High, Probability: Low)
1. **Market Volatility**: Extended trading hours may expose portfolio to overnight gaps
   - **Mitigation**: After-hours monitoring with 0.75% alert threshold
   - **Owner**: Risk Team

2. **IB Gateway Connectivity**: Production connection may differ from test environment
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with monitoring, immediate rollback capability
   - **Owner**: Trading Operations

### Medium Risks (Impact: Medium, Probability: Low)
1. **Data Quality**: 500-security universe may have some data gaps in production
   - **Mitigation**: Daily universe validation and fallback procedures
   - **Owner**: Data Team

2. **Alert Volume**: Increased monitoring may generate alert fatigue
   - **Mitigation**: Tuned thresholds and alert de-duplication
   - **Owner**: Operations Team

### Low Risks (Acceptable)
- Configuration drift between environments
- Minor performance degradation during peak hours
- Temporary alert delivery delays
